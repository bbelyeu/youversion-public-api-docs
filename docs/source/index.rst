YouVersion API Documentation
==================================================

üëãüèΩ Hello, and welcome!

We are so excited and thankful that you are interested in
building tools to help build the Kingdom!

This is the documentation site for our **currently very much in development**
public API's.

In the short term, we're starting with a public Verse Of The Day ("VOTD") API,
so that developers can build and experiment with projects that utilize
that information.


But first
=========

Before you'll be able to get started using the API's, you'll need to get
an access token to send along with each API request.

That's explained in the :ref:`getting-started` section.

If you already have a token, you can head on over to the API documentation, and
see example requests, responses, and how to interact with the API!
